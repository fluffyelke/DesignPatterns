Builder
    - When construction gets a little bit too complicated.

    Motivation.
        1. Some objects are simple and can be created in a single construction call
        2. But Some objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
                - For example when we have to create a string from a dozens of different calls.
        3. Having a constructor with a 10 arguments is not productive.

Builder - When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly



Summary for Builder
    - A Builder is a separate component for building a object.
    - Can either give it a constructor or return it via a static function.
    - To make a builder fluent, simply return this.
    - Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via base class.
