Factories
Factory method and Abstract Factory
    Motivation
        - Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
        - Constructor is not descriptive
            a) Name mandated by name of containing type.
            b) Cannot overload with sets of arguments with different names.
            c) Can turn into 'optional parameter Hell'
        - Object Creation(non-piecewise unlike Builder Pattern) can be outsourced to:
            a) A separate function (Factory Method).
            b) That may exist in separate class (Factory).
            c) Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory.


Factory: A component responsibly solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.
