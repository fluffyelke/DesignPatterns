Prototype pattern 
When it's easier to copy existing object, to fully initialize a new one.
    
    Motivation: 
        - Complicated objects, (e.g. cars) are not design from scratch.
            A) They reiterate existing designs.  (make them better)
        - Prototype is an existing(partially of fully constructed) design.
        - We make a copy(clone) the prototype and customize it.
            A) Requires a something called "deep copy" support
                - Make a copy recursively, and doing so we must be sure that this object, didnt 
                - change the object we just copy from.
        - We make cloning convenient  (e.g. via a Factory)


Prototype - A partially or fully initialized object that you copy(clone) and make use of.
